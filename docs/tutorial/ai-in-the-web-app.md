# AI in the web app

The **AI** menu has two sections for the web app, and a third that appears only in the downloaded desktop app. This page is the first two. The desktop section is [Desktop and a local IDE](desktop-and-local-ai.md).

Back to the [tutorial index](../TUTORIAL.md).

*Copy-and-paste actions are grouped above Call AI and credentials.*

## Copy for an external chat

Use this when you paste a prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or another chat you already pay for.

The three packing actions copy a prompt and remember the choice:

- **Embed files in prompt** — schema, template, and examples are inside the markdown.
- **Attach files in chat** — the prompt tells you which files to attach yourself.
- **Browse URIs (when available)** — the prompt points at URLs instead of embedding bytes.

**Copy prompt** repeats the last packing mode you chose.

Paste the model’s reply with **Import AI suggestions**. The dialog accepts raw JSON or an `intehrgrator-suggestions` fence. Validation errors stay in the dialog so you can copy them back to the chat. The format is [AI_SUGGESTION_FORMAT.md](../AI_SUGGESTION_FORMAT.md).

## Your own AI

Use this when intEHRgrator should call the model itself.

1. **AI credentials…** — pick a provider, endpoint, API key, and model. Credentials stay in this browser. They are never stored in the Project Bundle.
2. **Call AI** — sends the current prompt. The default mode uses mapping tools with the same names as MCP (`map_slot`, `import_suggestions`, `run_test`, …) and applies them on the open canvas. **Suggestions JSON only** is the older one-shot import.

On GitHub Pages the browser often cannot reach a cloud API (CORS). The desktop app forwards Call AI through its own server, so Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and OpenCode Zen work there. Key pages: [Call AI credentials](../AI_CREDENTIALS.md).

Refreshing a target or source opens a report with **Copy merge prompt** and **Call AI**. Blocks you detached stay on the canvas.

**Run Test** after any AI pass. See [Tests and export](tests-and-export.md).
