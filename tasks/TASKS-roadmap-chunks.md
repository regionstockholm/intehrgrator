# Tasks: Roadmap implementation chunks

Based on [docs/ROADMAP.md](../docs/ROADMAP.md) (current `main`, including 2026-08-27 additions) and [PRD-intehrgrator-v1.md](./PRD-intehrgrator-v1.md). Glossary: [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md).

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

Example:

- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task. If implementation steps happen to fulfil several things at once then ticking off several boxes is OK.

If running in interactive mode (e.g. Gemini CLI) then stop after each parent task and let user review. If running in autonomus batch mode e.g. dispatched to Jules, then just stop if user input is crucial in order to understand further steps.

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 1 frontier)

Asked after this plan was written, before coding Chunk 1. Recommended answers **adopted** so implementation can proceed; revisit if a later review disagrees.

❓ **Q1** - **Cogwheel scope**: The new B item replaces the encircled **+** popup with Blockly’s native cogwheel mutator (same family as `controls_if` elseif/else). Does that cover only container **Optional RM Insertion**, also DATA_VALUE **+ fields**, or template-optional skeleton slots too?

➡️ **Adopted: containers + DATA_VALUE shells.** Template-mandatory and silent-mandatory `ATTR_`* / `FLD_*` slots stay locked (not in the mutator stack). Optional RM extras (`OPT_*`) and optional DV fields (`OPTFLD_*`) are add/remove via the cogwheel. Skeleton `ATTR_*` mouths are not removed from the mutator.

---

❓ **Q2** - **Mutator UI**: Mini-workspace of stackable attribute blocks (true `MutatorIcon`, like if/elseif), or a cog that still opens a checkbox popup?

➡️ **Adopted: native** `MutatorIcon` **mini-workspace.** Flyout quark `optional_rm_mutator_item` / `dv_fields_mutator_item` with an attribute dropdown; container quark holds the STACK. HTML `#dialog-optional-rm` goes away.

---

❓ **Q3** - **Removing an optional attribute that already has children**: Disconnect and leave the subtree on the canvas (Blockly default), confirm-then-delete, or refuse until the child is detached?

➡️ **Adopted: disconnect / orphan.** `saveConnections` + `compose` reconnect remaining sockets; a removed extra’s child is left on the canvas, not silently deleted. Mapping Model `optionalRm[]` drops that insertion.

---

❓ **Q4** - **Empty slot vs auto child**: When the mutator *adds* `feeder_audit`, should the workbench only open an empty mouth (pure Blockly) or still auto-attach a typed child as today’s + picker does via `attachOptionalRmChild`?

➡️ **Adopted: auto-attach a typed child when the new mouth is empty** (same as current + picker). If a saved connection is already reconnected, do not create a second child.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Chunk order after this**: Next unfinished clusters are RM completeness (PARTY_IDENTIFIED / ITEM_STRUCTURE morph), mapping-editor undo, Handlebars hardening, and tables. Which next?

➡️ **Adopted: Chunk 2 = remaining B UX that shares Blockly editor surface (undo/redo, toolbox-search, Mapping Spec gutter markers); Chunk 3 = F RM completeness.** Handlebars and tables stay later (higher risk, less blocking).

## Grill round 3 (Chunk 4 frontier)

Asked before coding Chunk 4 (AI copy-paste polish). Recommended answers **adopted**.

❓ **Q1** - **openEHR references in prompt**: Should Copy AI Prompt mention the openehr-assistant MCP, link to docs, or both?

➡️ **Adopted: both.** Add an **openEHR references** section when the target is an openEHR template: hint to use the openehr-assistant MCP for spec/archetype lookup, plus links to `docs/OPENEHR_PRIMER.md`, `docs/AI_SUGGESTION_FORMAT.md`, and DeepWiki/ehrtslib.

---

❓ **Q2** - **Import button label**: Toolbar still says “Import Suggestions”; rename to “Import AI suggestions”?

➡️ **Adopted: already fixed on `main`.** No further work.

---

❓ **Q3** - **CI validation depth**: Should recurring CI call a live LLM, or only fixture/round-trip tests?

➡️ **Adopted: fixture/round-trip only; no live LLM in recurring CI.**

---

❓ **Q4** - **Suggestion envelope breadth**: Expand allowed value `block.type` list and prompt examples (e.g. `maps_get`, loops, party `name` slots)?

➡️ **Adopted: yes.** Add `maps_get` to schema + import codegen; document examples for defaults lookup, repeating containers, and party identity value slots (`name` via `source_query` / `text`).

---

❓ **Q5** - **Partial import**: On schema/apply errors, import valid entries only and report counts?

➡️ **Adopted: yes.** Keep apply-valid-only behaviour; surface applied / loops / skipped / errors / schema counts in the import dialog summary.

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 5 frontier)

Asked before coding Chunk 5 (local app + installable AI skill + agent/MCP driving). User answers **adopted** 2026-08-31.

❓ **Q1** - **Chunk 5 boundary**: Docs/skill only, thin Agent API, or full MCP server in this chunk?

➡️ **Adopted: C (MCP server in Chunk 5).** Include PEN-style MCP on the running desktop app. OK to **split implementation into separate commits/parts** (e.g. core service → HTTP API → MCP tools → docs/skill) for easier review and testing.

---

❓ **Q2** - **Primary agent workflow**: Files on disk, live session, copy-paste only, or combined?

➡️ **Adopted: D.** File-first baseline (`.intehrgrator` / project folder) **plus** live session when desktop is open. Web shell stays copy-paste primary.

---

❓ **Q3** - **API layer**: Extend test API, core service, HTTP wrapper, or phased extraction?

➡️ **Adopted: D (phased).** Extract **`WorkbenchService`** in core operating on **`ProjectBundle` / Blockly JSON / Mapping Model** — **no HTML DOM manipulation**. Desktop exposes localhost HTTP; MCP calls the same service. `intehrgratorTestApi` becomes a thin UI/test client where possible.

---

❓ **Q4** - **Write granularity**: Import-only, single-slot map, loops/optional RM/defaults, full workspace replace?

➡️ **Adopted: C + D.** Agent API must support **`importSuggestions`**, **loops**, **optional RM extras**, and **defaults map** edits. **`loadBlocklyJson` / full workspace replace** remains an escape hatch. Loops are first-class for mapping.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Concurrency & revision**: Defer, revision token only, undo exposure, or both?

➡️ **Adopted: D.** Mutating calls return a **revision token** (optimistic concurrency) **and** expose **undo / redo** on the Agent API.

---

❓ **Q6** - **Installable skill packaging**

➡️ **Adopted: A.** In-repo `.cursor/skills/intehrgrator-mapping/SKILL.md` (and agents mirror) **plus** `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.

---

❓ **Q7** - **Golden path documentation**

➡️ **Adopted: B primary** — IDE + **desktop app side-by-side**; agent calls **localhost API** while user watches the canvas update. **Fallback (C-like):** when MCP/API is unavailable, document read-only / downstream export of mapping spec or generated conversion script (not round-trip authoring).

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 5 follow-up — multi-agent MCP presence & attribution)

Asked after Chunk 5 shipped (0.3 desktop: Agent API + MCP + skill). Deferred from 5.3: scroll/highlight, multi-agent visibility, actor-attributed undo. User answers **adopted** 2026-08-31 (Q7 resolved via design investigation).

Context from product direction:

- Scrolling the **main** Mapping Editor canvas to follow an agent likely **disrupts** a human who is editing or reviewing elsewhere on the canvas.
- The existing **Open canvas** button (`openCanvasSnapshot` / `workspace_snapshot.ts`) opens a **separate popup** with a standalone Blockly SVG (print/save today). That window could become a **live observer** for agent activity — PEN-style — without moving the user's viewport.
- Chunk 5 already has **revision tokens + undo/redo** on `WorkbenchService` / Agent API, but undo entries carry **no actor** (user vs named agent). Blockly's native undo stack is separate and also actor-less.
- Roadmap D still has an open item: MCP scroll/highlight (currently unchecked).

❓ **Q1** - **Chunk placement**: Where does multi-agent MCP presence land relative to schema toolboxes (current Chunk 6)?

**A** — New **Chunk 6** (multi-agent MCP UX + attribution); push dynamic schema toolboxes to Chunk 7+.  
**B** — Small **Chunk 5.1** patch release before any Chunk 6 work.  
**C** — Fold into Chunk 6 schema toolboxes (same PR).  
**D** — Split: **6a** actor/undo attribution only; **6b** observer UI / colours later.

➡️ **Adopted: B.** Chunk **5.1** patch release before schema toolboxes (Chunk 6).

---

❓ **Q2** - **Main canvas behaviour on agent edits**: Should MCP/API mutations ever scroll or pan the primary Mapping Editor?

**A** — **Never** auto-scroll/pan the main canvas on agent edits (user keeps full viewport control).  
**B** — Opt-in toolbar setting: “Follow active agent”.  
**C** — Scroll/pan **only** in the observer window (see Q3), never the main canvas.  
**D** — Brief in-canvas flash/highlight on touched blocks **without** changing scroll position.

➡️ **Adopted: B + D.** Opt-in **Follow active agent** (default off). When off, at most subtle pulse/highlight on touched blocks **without** scroll. Observer window handles spatial tracking.

---

❓ **Q3** - **Observer surface**: How should users *watch* multiple simultaneous agents (PEN.dev-like)?

**A** — Extend **Open canvas** popup into a **live multi-agent observer** (layered SVG, per-agent colour, legend with agent names). Static print/save remains available.  
**B** — New dedicated **“Agent activity”** top-level window (separate from Open canvas).  
**C** — Docked **pane inside** the main window (split view below or beside Mapping Editor).  
**D** — No live UI — agents only; user reads MCP logs / IDE chat.

➡️ **Adopted: A.** Live observer via extended Open canvas popup; print/save retained.

---

❓ **Q4** - **Agent identity (name, id, colour)**: How are concurrent agents distinguished?

**A** — **Register on connect** (MCP `initialize` or new `register_agent` tool): `{ agentId, displayName, color? }`.  
**B** — Pass **`agentName` / `agentId` on every mutating API call** (header or JSON field); desktop assigns colour from id hash if omitted.  
**C** — Desktop **UI registry** — user names/colours agents before IDE connects.  
**D** — Anonymous sessions; colour by MCP connection order only.

➡️ **Adopted: B + A combined.** MCP session **registers** at start (`register_agent` or extended `initialize`): `{ agentId, displayName?, color? }` — name persists for the session. Mutations carry identity for attribution. Desktop returns assigned **name + colour** to the agent (agent may **suggest** a name from user prompt). Optional user override in desktop UI later.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Highlight semantics**: What does each agent’s colour mean, and for how long?

**A** — **Transient** outline on blocks/slots touched by last mutation; fade after N seconds.  
**B** — **Persistent** tint on all blocks last edited by that agent until someone else edits them.  
**C** — **Observer window only** — full per-agent layers; main canvas shows only neutral bundle sync (no colours).  
**D** — **Dual**: subtle badge/pulse on main canvas + full colour-coded overlay in observer window.

➡️ **Adopted: D.** Subtle main-canvas signal; full per-agent layers in observer.

---

❓ **Q6** - **Undo/redo attribution**: Who gets credit in history — and where is it stored?

**A** — **`WorkbenchService` / Agent API undo stack only** — each entry `{ actor: user | agent, id, displayName, revision, summary }`; Blockly native undo unchanged for direct user block edits.  
**B** — **Unified history** — merge Blockly events + service snapshots into one timeline with actor on every row.  
**C** — **Separate stacks** — “Undo my edit” (Blockly) vs “Undo last agent change” (API).  
**D** — Extend **Blockly custom events** (`DocumentSwapEvent`, future slot events) with an `actor` field so one stack serves both.

➡️ **Adopted direction:** **Joint undo/redo history** with actor on every entry, plus **UI affordances like C** (“Undo my edit” / “Undo last agent change” / walk full timeline). **Feasible without CRDT in Phase 1** — see design investigation [`tasks/DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md`](./DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md). Phase 1: append-only attributed history log + unify UI/service session + debounced Blockly commits into same log. Phase 2+: CRDT on **Mapping Model slots** (Automerge / Yjs / Loro — do not reinvent) when human multi-user live co-editing is required.

---

❓ **Q7** - **Simultaneous writes & conflicts**: Two agents edit different slots at once — what happens?

**A** — **Revision + 409** (current): second writer refreshes snapshot and retries; no slot-level locking.  
**B** — **Slot leases**: optional `POST /api/v1/lease-slot` so an agent holds a slotId while thinking.  
**C** — **Serial queue** per project — one mutation at a time globally.  
**D** — **Merge report** — apply non-conflicting slot updates; return conflicts for human/agent retry (like partial import).

➡️ **Adopted (from design investigation):** **Phase 5.1: A + D** — revision + 409; slot-level **merge report** for batch agent writes (reuse partial-import pattern). **Phase 5.2 optional: + B** slot leases. **Phase 6+ multi-user humans: + CRDT on model.** Avoid global serial queue (C). Details: [`tasks/DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md`](./DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md#q7-recommendation-after-analysis).

---

## Grill round 2 (Chunk 5.1 — undo/history semantics)

Asked after [`DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md`](./DESIGN-multi-agent-undo-crdt.md). User answers **adopted** 2026-08-31.

❓ **Q1** - **Session unification / history commits:** Immediate revision bump per canvas edit, or batched commits?

➡️ **Adopted: semantics-based, not time-based.** Record history when **mapping semantics** change: block **attached / detached / added / removed**, slot **expression** change, **loop** / **optionalRm** / **import** mutations. **Ignore** pure x/y layout moves until something structural changes. Coalesce multiple semantic events in one “transaction burst” if they share one user gesture (e.g. mutator compose). Agents bump revision on each API mutation (already atomic).

---

❓ **Q2** - **Selective undo semantics:** Snapshot replace vs compensating merge?

➡️ **Adopted: both, user-chosen + timeline.** Provide:
1. **Timeline scrubber** — run forward/backward for **viewing** (read-only playback at each `seq`).
2. **Destructive rollback** — jump to history point `seq` after **warning/confirmation** (replaces document state; truncates or forks redo — TBD in implementation).
3. **Compensating patch (best-effort)** — attempt to remove effects of a **single** history entry while keeping later work; may fail on conflicts. Offer **AI-assisted patch**: generate a small prompt + metadata for an external agent with MCP access to history/undo; result appended as **new timeline entry** (undoable if it messes up).

Shortcut menu items (“Undo my last edit”, “Undo last agent change”) remain filters on the same timeline.

---

❓ **Q3** - **Blockly history granularity:**

➡️ **Adopted: same as Q1** — semantic attach/detach/add/remove and mapping-field changes only; not x/y.

---

❓ **Q4** - **History retention:**

➡️ **Adopted: no arbitrary cap** unless memory risk. **Web:** warn user before purging oldest entries if approaching memory limit. **Desktop/local:** persist history **on disk** (append log / sidecar with project); load recent window into memory as needed.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Human multi-user roadmap:**

➡️ **Adopted: yes, near end of roadmap.** Chunk 5.1 = **architecture-only prep** in [`tasks/ARCHITECTURE-multi-user-collab-prep.md`](./ARCHITECTURE-multi-user-collab-prep.md). Full CRDT/sync deferred to **Chunk 14**.

---

## Grill round 3 (Chunk 5.1 — timeline UX & patch undo)

Asked after grill round 2 history semantics. User answers **adopted** 2026-08-31.

❓ **Q1** - **Destructive rollback:** Offer save/download of discarded branch?

➡️ **Adopted: yes.** Before destructive `restore-at`, offer download of the discarded branch as a full **`.intehrgrator`** project file (`POST /export-discarded`).

---

❓ **Q2** - **Patch undo format:** Free text vs strict suggestions envelope?

➡️ **Adopted: strict `intehrgrator-suggestions` version 2** via `build_patch_prompt` / `POST /patch-prompt` — apply with `import_suggestions`, not prose patches.

---

❓ **Q3** - **Undo/redo discoverability:** Hint observer window on main canvas undo?

➡️ **Adopted: yes.** Main Undo/Redo tooltips point users to **Open observer** for full attributed timeline (main canvas Blockly undo remains for direct edits).

---

❓ **Q4** - **History granularity:** One entry per semantic change?

➡️ **Adopted: yes** — same semantics as grill round 2 Q1/Q3 (attach/detach/expression/import; ignore pure x/y).

---

- [x] 6.0 Chunk 6 — Schema-driven dynamic toolboxes (roadmap H)

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 6 frontier — dynamic schema toolboxes)

Asked after **0.4** desktop release (Chunk 5.1 shipped: multi-agent observer, attributed history). User answers **adopted** 2026-08-31.

Context from current code:

- JSON Schema / XML Schema targets already load via **Target Format Handler** → `SkeletonNode[]` → generic `target_structure` / `target_value` canvas blocks.
- `buildDemoToolbox` adds a **Target schema** flyout (prefilled generic blocks, **max 40**, flat list) when a JSON/XSD target is loaded — not per-type Blockly definitions.
- openEHR targets use typed RM blocks + cogwheel optional-field mutators; JSON/XSD has **no equivalent mutator** for optional properties.
- **Generic JSON** and **Generic XML** drawers already exist (`json_object` / `json_array` / `json_value`, `xml_element` / `xml_text`) and must **stay always visible** for ad-hoc structure authoring.
- PRD Q7 (JSON/XSD) answered **B**: generic output blocks **and** dynamically generated blocks from the selected schema — only the generic half exists today.

❓ **Q1** - **Block vocabulary + toolbox layering:** Generic JSON/XML vs schema-specific drawers?

➡️ **Adopted (user composite — supersedes A/B/C):**

1. **Always visible:** generic **JSON-structure** and **XML-structure** toolboxes so users can build **any** JSON or XML structure/instance (free-form, not tied to loaded target).
2. **On target load:** automatically plug in **schema-specific toolbox drawer(s)** for the loaded JSON Schema / XML Schema target.
3. **Schema-specific drawer behaviour ≈ openEHR:** mandatory attributes/fields visible; optional ones add/remove via **cogwheel mutator**; **canvas scaffold** instantiated from **mandatory** fields only.
4. **Defaults Map:** an **empty** Defaults Map block may be placed on canvas for JSON/XSD targets, but **must not** participate in scaffolding (schema unknown until runtime load — no pre-wired default points like openEHR OPT).

---

❓ **Q2** - **Optional property UX (JSON/XSD):** How should users add/remove non-mandatory schema fields?

➡️ **Adopted: A (generalize cogwheel mutator)** — same family as RM `optional_rm_mutator` / `dv_fields_mutator`, driven by skeleton optional-field catalog for schema structure blocks. See Q1.

---

❓ **Q3** - **Target schema drawer shape:** How to organize the dynamic drawer for large schemas?

➡️ **Adopted: B — nested categories** mirroring the schema tree (complexTypes / `$defs` / XSD sections), similar to how openEHR nests Entries / Items / Party / DV drawers — not a flat 40-block cap.

---

❓ **Q4** - **TakeCare integration mode**

➡️ **Deferred** — TakeCare-specific fixture/validation to **later roadmap** (not Chunk 6). Chunk 6 proves **arbitrary** JSON/XSD schema load; TakeCare becomes a manual or late golden when schema toolbox is stable.

---

❓ **Q5** - **TakeCare term identifiers (test vs prod)**

➡️ **Deferred** with Q4 — term-id blocks / test-prod system switch **not in Chunk 6**.

---

❓ **Q6** - **Canvas vs toolbox parity** *(reframed — original wording was unclear)*

**What this meant:** When you load a JSON/XSD target, should the **canvas auto-scaffold** (mandatory tree on load) use the **same block “shapes”** as the schema-specific toolbox drawer — or stay generic while only the toolbox is schema-aware?

**openEHR reference today:** loading an OPT scaffolds typed RM blocks on canvas **and** the toolbox offers matching typed blocks + cogwheel optional fields.

➡️ **Adopted (from Q1 — openEHR parity):** **Both** canvas scaffold and schema-specific toolbox use **schema-aware structure blocks** (named after schema types / elements). Mandatory nodes appear on canvas at load; optional via cogwheel. **Generic JSON/XML drawers remain separate** and always available for ad-hoc editing outside the schema scaffold — they do not replace the schema-specific vocabulary.

---

❓ **Q7** - **Toolbox refresh + Agent API** *(reframed — original wording was unclear)*

**What this meant:** When the user (or agent) loads a new target schema, how should **IDE agents** learn the new **slotIds** and toolbox structure?

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **A** | Refresh toolbox on target load; **`build_prompt` / Copy AI Prompt manifest** lists slotIds (current Agent API path). |
| **B** | New dedicated **`GET /api/v1/schema-toolbox`** returning drawer tree + slotIds for MCP agents. |
| **C** | Agents read **`/bundle` only**; no toolbox metadata API. |

➡️ **Adopted: A.** Refresh toolbox when target loads; slotIds stay in **`build_prompt` manifest** and bundle skeleton (existing golden path). No new schema-toolbox HTTP endpoint in Chunk 6 unless a follow-up need appears.

---

### Chunk 6 implementation notes (from adoption)

- **Audit generic JSON/XML blocks** (`json_object`, `json_array`, `json_value`, `xml_element`, `xml_text`) for formalism gaps (attributes, namespaces, mixed content, JSON null/boolean, etc.) and usability; extend drawers before or alongside schema-specific work.
- Replace flat `schemaFlyoutContents` (40-cap) with **nested category builder** from `SkeletonNode[]`.
- Generalize **cogwheel mutator** to schema structure blocks; wire optional catalog from target format handler.
- **`skeleton_loader`**: scaffold mandatory schema tree on canvas (openEHR-like policy).
- **`syncToolbox`**: invalidate on target load + skeleton structure hash (not just length).
- TakeCare / vendor-specific term ids → late roadmap (after CSV/FHIR tables or dedicated vendor chunk).

- [x] 7.0 Chunk 7 — Template languages: Kintegrate Handlebars + Go text/template codegen (roadmap G)

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 7 frontier — template languages)

Asked before coding Chunk 7. User answers **adopted** 2026-09-03.

Context from the mapping scripts in `examples/patient-reported-chemotherapy-symptoms/mapping/`:

- Go `text/template` scripts converting openEHR FLAT → TakeCare ProfdocHISMessage XML (legacy EHR narrative).
- Execute context: `{ Parameters: {Time, PatientId, …}, Data: {"flat/path|value": "Nej", …} }`.
- Templates use `{{ index .Data "long/path" }}`, `{{ eq … }}`, `{{ if and … }}`, `{{ define "cleanAndQuoteFreeTextInput" }}…{{ end }}`, and Sprig helpers: `replace`, `regexReplaceAll`, `trim`, `quote`, `lower`, `substr`, `int`, `ge`.
- Target is XML (free-form), not openEHR.
- No `range`/`with` iteration — single-event questionnaire at fixed `:0` positions.

❓ **Q1** - **Chunk 7 boundary**: One chunk or split?

➡️ **Adopted: one chunk.** Split PRs/commits inside.

---

❓ **Q2** - **Go template surfaces**: Tab + codegen, snippet block only, or both?

➡️ **Adopted: codegen-only.** Go template has **no Authored Template tab** — it is purely a Conversion script language with Blockly codegen (like TypeScript). Handlebars keeps its Template tab (Kintegrate compatibility).

---

❓ **Q3** - **Execute envelope**: Where does `Parameters` come from in Test Run?

➡️ **Adopted: Defaults Map → Parameters.** Execute builds `{ Parameters: defaults, Data: flatInstance }`. The Go service pipeline injects Parameters externally.

---

❓ **Q4** - **FuncMap / Sprig subset**: Full Sprig or curated?

➡️ **Adopted: curated 8 + seam.** `replace`, `regexReplaceAll`, `trim`, `quote`, `lower`, `substr`, `int`, `ge`. FuncMap as adapter for future full Sprig.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Bundle persistence**: New field or reuse existing?

➡️ **Adopted: no new field.** Add `go-template` to `ConversionScriptLanguage`. Blockly mapping is already persisted as `blocklyState`. Generated Go template is derived (not stored).

---

❓ **Q6** - **Handlebars Authored Template: execute in Conversion Test Run?**

➡️ **Adopted: yes.** Execute Authored Handlebars Template in Conversion Test Run when Handlebars is the selected Output mode. Extends ADR 0003.

---

❓ **Q7** - **Handlebars Blockly→codegen (parallel to Go template codegen)?**

➡️ **Adopted: defer.** Harden Handlebars Authored Template path in this chunk. Blockly→Handlebars codegen is a future chunk.

---

❓ **Q8** - **Example Set**: The reverse-engineered Blockly mapping uses XML blocks for the ProfdocHISMessage structure. The hand-authored PROD Go template lives alongside as reference.

➡️ **Adopted: register in `example-sets.json`.** A future roadmap item adds a similar reverse-engineered Handlebars example set plus non-Blockly editing support so the Handlebars test harness works with example files and expected output.

---

❓ **Q9** - **In-app Go runtime**: WASM for Web Shell + desktop.

➡️ **Adopted: WASM.** Vendor prebuilt `.wasm` + `wasm_exec.js` with curated FuncMap. TinyGo if size is an issue.

---

❓ **Q10** - **Go template codegen**: `generate(model, "go-template")` walks Mapping Model + Blockly state, emits Go template syntax.

➡️ **Adopted.** Source queries → `{{ index .Data "path" }}`; conditionals → `{{ if eq … }}`; XML blocks → literal XML; Defaults Map → `{{ .Parameters.Key }}`.

---

❓ **Q11** - **Click-to-Map for Go template**: Output-mode-agnostic. Inserts Blockly blocks; codegen handles the rest.

➡️ **Adopted.**

---

❓ **Q12** - **`source_query_node` Listening Mode**: Treat like other source query blocks.

➡️ **Adopted.**

---

❓ **Q13** - **Harden Handlebars preview**: Fixture-first, independent of Go.

➡️ **Adopted.**

---

### Chunk 7 implementation notes (from adoption)

- **Go template is codegen-only** — no Authored Template tab. Handlebars keeps its tab.
- **Execute envelope** `{ Parameters: defaults, Data: source }` for Go Test Run.
- **WASM runtime** with curated Sprig-subset FuncMap baked in.
- **Reverse-engineered Blockly example** uses `xml_element`/`xml_text` blocks for ProfdocHISMessage structure, `controls_if` for conditional symptom emission, `source_query` for FLAT paths, `maps_get` for Parameters.
- **Future:** reverse-engineered Handlebars example set + non-Blockly editing for Handlebars test harness (added to roadmap).

Chunk 7 merged in PR #22 with **7.6** left open. Grill Q13 already adopted fixture-first hardening independent of Go. No new grill round — implement directly.

### Chunk 7.1 implementation notes (from Q13 + post-merge audit)

- Kintegrate fixtures (`intro`, `mdk_rek_demo`, `air-oxygenation`, `handlebars-script1`) already pass via direct `renderHandlebars`; **Mapping preview** path (`runTest` with `outputMode: "preview"` + free-form target) lacks parity tests.
- `handlebars()` builtin in `query_runtime.ts` does not pass `_slots` — breaks `{{slot}}` inside `text_handlebars` slot expressions.
- ADR 0003 / `CONTEXT.md` still say Handlebars Conversion mode does not execute (stale after 7.5).

- [ ] 8.0 Chunk 8 — CSV / FHIR tables (roadmap C)

## Grill round 1 (Chunk 8 frontier — CSV / FHIR tables)

Asked before coding Chunk 8. **Awaiting user adoption.**

Context: Roadmap §C items 26–27. Chunk 1D **map blocks** (`maps_create_with`, `maps_get`, `defaults_block`) are done. AI/docs already mention ICD-10→SNOMED via `maps_get("icd10_snomed", …)` but there is **no UI** to author named terminology maps, **no paste/import**, and **non-`defaults` `maps_get` is incomplete** in TS/XQuery/Go codegen. No FHIR/ConceptMap code exists.

❓ **Q1** - **Chunk 8 boundary**: One chunk or split?

**A** — One chunk (CSV paste + named maps + lookup E2E); FHIR import in same PR.  
**B** — **Chunk 8 MVP** (paste → named 1D/2-column map + `maps_get` pipeline fix); **Chunk 8.1** (full N×M grid + FHIR ConceptMap).  
**C** — Defer tables entirely; do Chunk 9 (conversion goldens) next.

➡️ **Recommended: B.** Chunk 8 proves paste + terminology lookup on existing map blocks; full grid editor and FHIR are large enough to split.

---

❓ **Q2** - **Table model for MVP**: Extend `maps_create_with` or introduce a new 2D `table_*` block family?

**A** — Paste TSV/CSV into **2-column** `maps_create_with` (key → value); optional header row.  
**B** — New `table_create` block with row/column names, typed columns, and separate lookup blocks.  
**C** — Both in Chunk 8.

➡️ **Recommended: A for MVP.** Matches today's `maps_get` and Defaults Map extraction. Full N×M grid is stretch (Q1 B → 8.1).

---

❓ **Q3** - **Named terminology maps on canvas**: How does the user name a map (e.g. `icd10_snomed`)?

**A** — Add `NAME` field to top-level `maps_create_with` (not only on `maps_get`).  
**B** — New `terminology_map` block wrapping `maps_create_with`.  
**C** — Keep maps nested under `defaults_block` only; terminology maps live in IndexedDB catalog.

➡️ **Recommended: A + catalog.** Top-level named `maps_create_with` in Maps drawer; load/save via catalog pattern like Defaults Map (reuse or extend `idb_catalog`).

---

❓ **Q4** - **Paste UX**: Where does clipboard/file import land?

**A** — Maps toolbox category: **Paste table** → dialog → spawns named `maps_create_with` on canvas.  
**B** — Context menu on existing `maps_create_with` (paste replaces/appends rows).  
**C** — Separate **Tables** pane (like Defaults panel).

➡️ **Recommended: A + B.** Flyout action for new map; paste-into-existing for edits. No new pane in MVP.

---

❓ **Q5** - **Lookup blocks for MVP**: `maps_get` only, or add index/content lookup?

**A** — **`maps_get` only** (key-based); fix named-map runtime + codegen (TS, XQuery, Go template).  
**B** — Add `table_lookup_row` / `table_lookup_column` (index + content search).  
**C** — Add composite return block producing `DV_CODED_TEXT` (code + rubric from two columns).

➡️ **Recommended: A in Chunk 8.** `maps_get` is enough for ICD→SNOMED; index/content and DV_CODED_TEXT composite → 8.1+.

---

❓ **Q6** - **Codegen / Test Run envelope**: How do named maps reach conversion scripts?

**A** — `namedMapsFromBlocklyState` → Test Run `ctx.namedMaps`; TS/XQuery/Go emit `maps_get("name", key)` against convert-time map args.  
**B** — Inline map literals at codegen time (bake table into script).  
**C** — Go template only: extra top-level fields beside `Parameters` / `Data`.

➡️ **Recommended: A** (consistent with ADR 0002 convert-time maps). Today non-`defaults` names are broken or stubbed — fix in Chunk 8.

---

❓ **Q7** - **TSV/CSV parsing rules for Excel/Sheets paste**:

**A** — Tab-separated first (clipboard from Excel/Sheets); comma fallback for `.csv` files.  
**B** — RFC 4180 CSV only.  
**C** — User picks delimiter in paste dialog.

➡️ **Recommended: A + C light.** Default TSV for paste; file import offers delimiter if autodetect fails.

---

❓ **Q8** - **Example set / tests**:

**A** — Small fixture: 2-column ICD→SNOMED map + `maps_get` in a slot expression + Test Run.  
**B** — Register in `example-sets.json`.  
**C** — Unit tests only (no example set).

➡️ **Recommended: A + C.** Example set optional; unit + integration tests required.

---

❓ **Q9** - **FHIR ConceptMap / ValueSet import** (roadmap C line 27):

**A** — In Chunk 8 MVP (parse FHIR JSON → `maps_create_with`).  
**B** — Chunk 8.1 after paste MVP ships.  
**C** — Out of scope until a concrete FHIR fixture is chosen.

➡️ **Recommended: B.** No FHIR code in repo; paste MVP unblocks the same use case manually.

---

❓ **Q10** - **Bundle persistence**: Where do pasted tables live?

**A** — Blockly workspace JSON only (project bundle).  
**B** — Separate `mapping.terminologyMaps.json` sidecar in bundle.  
**C** — IndexedDB catalog only (not in bundle).

➡️ **Recommended: A.** Named `maps_create_with` blocks on canvas, same as Defaults Map — already persisted in `blocklyState`.

---

### Chunk 8 implementation notes (pending adoption)

- **MVP:** TSV/CSV paste → named `maps_create_with`; Maps flyout + paste-into-block; fix `namedMaps` + `maps_get` through Test Run and all codegen adapters.
- **Stretch (8.1):** N×M grid, row/column typing, `table_lookup_*` blocks, FHIR ConceptMap import, composite `DV_CODED_TEXT` lookup.
- **Explicitly defer:** Roadmap B “inline hardcoded map” right-click; `maps_keys`/`maps_length` in codegen unless trivial.
