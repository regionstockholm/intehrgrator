# Instructions for AI programming agents

## Documentation guidance

- Always prefer reading and analyzing original documentation of latest version
  of libraries and projects rather than random search hits or training data that may be of lower quality or based on outdated versions.
- It is good to offload some tasks to external MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  - If you are a local agent (e.g. Gemini CLI), you already have a built in way
    to access MCP servers, but you may need to ask user to add certain MCP
    servers to you configuration (please do ask if you can not to it yourself).
  - If you are Jules or any other AI that does _not_ have direct MCP tool access,
    you must use one of the following official MCP clients, also see details and
    examples in the file AGENTS-jules-MCP-hints.md:
    - **TypeScript:** Use the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package. See the
      [TypeScript SDK documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-mcp-clients)
      for usage details.
    - **Python:** Use the `fastmcp` library. See the
      [FastMCP client documentation](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) for
      usage details. A successful connection to the Deepwiki server has been
      established using this client.
- Deepwiki.com is a great source for outsourcing analysis of any project on
  github. If possible, delegate your questions about the library to the Deepwiki
  MCP server. Successful connections to the Deepwiki server has been established
  using all the methods described above, so if conenction fails stop and ask
  user for help, don't try to invent other ways to call MCP servers. If you are
  a local agent (e.g. Gemini CLI), you should have direct access to the Deepwiki MCP tools already (configured by user), if not install that or ask user for help. Do NOT proceed without deepwiki access
- The DeepWiki MCP server offers three main tools:
  1. read_wiki_structure - Get a list of documentation topics for a GitHub
     repository
  2. read_wiki_contents - View documentation about a GitHub repository
  3. ask_question - Ask any question about a GitHub repository and get an
     AI-powered, context-grounded response

## Development process guidance

- If asked to make a `PRD` (Product Requirements Document) based on a prompt,
  then follow the instructions in
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/refs/heads/main/create-prd.md
- If asked to create a `task list` then look in the /tasks subdirectory for a
  PRD file to base it on. If there are several PRD files that don't already have
  associated task lists, then ask user for disambiguation. Then follow
  instructions in
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/refs/heads/main/generate-tasks.md
  using the PRD file as input. Refer to PRD in task list document.
- Put PRDs and task lists in a /tasks subdirectory
- The task list file(s) should contain a section called "Instructions for
  Completing Tasks" with the following content:

```
**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps. 
Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task. If implementation steps happen to fulfil several things at once then ticking off several boxes is OK.

If running in interactive mode (e.g. Gemini CLI) then stop after each parent task and let user review. If running in autonomus batch mode e.g. dispatched to Jules, then just stop if user input is crucial in order to understand further steps.
```

## Development tooling guidance

- When working with Javascript or Typescript based projects prefer using Deno
  for management over using Node.js and NPM. Deno is installed in the local
  environment, but Jules might need to install Deno in its VM before using it.
- The local environment is a Windows machine without admin privileges,
  Powershell is available. It uses [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) for package
  installation, so base any advice on that.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- This repository is currently **specification/planning only** — it contains
  Markdown docs (`README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `INITIAL_PROMPT.md`, `docs/`), a PRD
  (`tasks/PRD-intehrgrator-v1.md`), a Pencil wireframe (`mapping-interface.pen`),
  and a UI mockup PNG. There is **no application code, `package.json`, lockfile,
  build, lint, or test target yet**, so there is nothing to install/build/run.
  Do not fabricate an app or dependency setup based on this note alone.
- Intended stack (per the PRD/prompt): a local-first TypeScript static web app
  (GitHub Pages "Web Shell") using Blockly + CodeMirror, `ehrtslib` for openEHR
  TypeScript, and `fontoxpath` for source queries; a VS Code extension follows
  later. Per repo preference, this is a **Deno-based** project (not Node/npm).
- `deno` (latest stable, 2.9.0 at setup time) is installed in the VM and on
  `PATH` via `~/.deno/env` (sourced from `~/.bashrc`). Node.js and `pnpm` also
  happen to be present but are not the intended toolchain. Use `deno` for
  install/lint/test/run/build once code exists (e.g. `deno install`,
  `deno lint`, `deno test`, `deno task <name>`).
- Once implementation begins and a `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` (or `package.json`)
  appears, the startup update script already runs `deno install` to fetch
  dependencies. Until then it is a no-op.
